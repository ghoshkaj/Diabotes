# Poe server bot quick start

Welcome to the Poe server bot quick start. This repository serves as a companion to our
[tutorial](https://creator.poe.com/docs/quick-start) and contains starter code that
allows you to quickly get a bot running. The following are some of the examples included
in this repo. Note that the starter code assumes you have Modal setup for deployment
(the instructions for which are described in the aforementioned
[tutorial](https://creator.poe.com/docs/quick-start))

### EchoBot

This bot simply repeats the user's query in the response and provides a good starting
point to build any type of bot. To deploy, run `modal deploy echobot.py`

A correct implementation would look like https://poe.com/EchoBotDemonstration
